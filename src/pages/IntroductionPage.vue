            Good day! 
        </p>
        <p> 
            You are about to conduct a usability test of the design (blueprint) of
            <b>CCCSP</b> (Calabanga Community College Student Portal). This will 
            approximately take 10-30 minutes depending on your speed.

        <p> 
            <a style="color:green">
                <b>You will not test an actual app. Rather, you will test a <i>proposed design only</i>.</b>
            </a>
        </p>
        <p> 
            Please keep your participation and the details of this activity <b>confidential</b>.

            <option value="MOBILE">I was asked to handle the MOBILE version of the app.</option>
            <option value="WEB">I was asked to handle the WEB version of the app.</option>
